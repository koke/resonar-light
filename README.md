# Resonar Light

This is a child theme of [Resonar](https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/resonar/).
I liked Resonar and it's almost what I wanted, but there were a few things I wanted to tweak.

This theme might not be useful for anyone else, but I'm sharing anyway.
Note that I've been very aggressive trying to reduce page size and load times, and removing everything that I wasn't using.
In my case, it's for a text only blog, so that includes things like retina image support.

## Differences from Resonar

- Uses web font loader
- Limit font subset to latin
- Replaces Playfair Display with Libre Baskerville, as the former is disabled for the Spanish translation
- Added some CSS tweaks to the header and sidebar that I previously had on Jetpack's custom css
- Disabled emoji JS/CSS
- Disabled devicepx JS
